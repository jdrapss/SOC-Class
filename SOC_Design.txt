SOC Standards
Security Operations Standards - Should be deployed alongside policies. Should never be standalone
- Standards set the parameters and boundaries for policy provisions
- Most standards are applicable to security operations technology
    - Incident response facilitation tools
        - Designed to help incident response team members learn relevant information, divide responsibilites, and notify each other about the status
        of each task undertaken in accordance with each responsibility
    - Forensics technology
        - Forensic tools enable incident response effort members to analyze and archive information gathered during
        forensics investigations in a manner that proves valid if a court case based on an incident occurs.
    - Network security monitoring tools
        - Syntax for creating and documenting network detection rules
    - Threat intelligence tools
- These standards should use version control (CONFLUENCE)
    - How they must be configured
    - How frequently they must be updated
