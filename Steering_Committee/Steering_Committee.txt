Steering Comittee - Phase 1: Design
    - Design: Requirements, capabilities, and services offered
        - Defining our business needs
Steering Committee - Phase 2: Build
    - Build: Assure alignment with design objectives
        - Ensure that our plans in the design phase are implemented affectively
Steering Committee - Phase 3: Operational Oversight: 
    - Operational Oversight: Guiding SOC adaptation and performance improvements in response to changing IT requirements and business drivers.
        - Making the SOC more agile in handling new business drivers such as Mobile Forensics, Threat Intelligence, Security Monitoring
            - This means having strong, well implemented and well documented policy guidelines, compliance frameworks, etc.

The steering committee will provide input on what they do and do not want in regards to SOC efforts. Normally stakeholders would be legal team, HR, etc.,
but we manage ourselves internally with minimal approval from executive leadership. Mutual cooperation of stakeholders during feedback and incident response
will rely heavily on the internally defined organizational units.

- Developing Requirements with Key Stakeholders
- Steering committee normally consists of stakeholders such as Business unit managers, Legal, HR, etc.
    - Our SOC should define stakeholders as:
        - Orginizational Units as Stakeholders:
            - Policy, Procedure, Governance, Compliance
            - Technical Leadership (Current and New technical project leadership)
            - Forensics Proxy (Receiving work from DCO to pass down to SOC analysts as necessary, communicating tickets, background information, necessary equipment, and procedures necessary to assit)
            - Systems Administration and Network Engineering
- Must define the following at the SOC level:
    - Business or Operational Plans
        - Determining where the SOC currently stands, and what is most needed from a strategy perspective
            - Maturity in current procedures, automating weaknesses, filling gaps in current areas of concern.
                - Using Jira to fix specific communication errors (Specific issue types that provide necessary Confluence pages)
            - Setting specific business drivers to give us a path forward (i.e. Threat Intelligence capabilities, Vulnerability Assessment (Available but needs smoothing))
    - Internal and External Auditing
        - Auditing Confluence
        - Monthly Client Sensor Health Reports
        - Monthly SOC Alarm Metrics Reports
        - Policy, Procedure, and Compliance Reports
            - Are our staff following the mentioned reports, procedures, and compliance frameworks we have implemented?
            - Updating and enforcing rSOC Policies in 
                - How can we automate this?
                - Review updates, changes, current use of policy and procedure often
                    - Updates to rSOC Incident Reporting proceduers
    
    - Strategy documents for legal and regulatory Compliance
        - What are our strategy documents? Are they located in Confluence?
    - Compliance frameworks in use?
        - What are our compliance frameworks (COBIT, NIST, ISO 27000)?
    - Compromise scenarios
        - Handling internal and client-facing incidents using public and industry specific standards
        - Start with any formal risk documentation that is present
            - If none are present, research risk documentation
                
Material Discussed during the Design Phase:
- Aligning SOC design with business needs is crucial
    - If our efforts as a SOC are not coordinated with the mission and objectives of the rest of the company,
    then we will have sub-optimal performance.
- SOC must have situational awareness of the business
- Steering committe (Internally-defined organizational units)
    - Current and new business drivers for the SOC
        - Do we want a Governance, Risk, and Compliance(GRC) SOC addressing legal requirements, and/or
        do we want a strong technical SOC that can handle any and all technical challenges. Finding a middle-ground here is important.
    - Legal Requirements
    - Security Policies
    - Organizational Culture
